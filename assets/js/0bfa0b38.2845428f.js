Of course, there\'s always the possibility of playing when you\'re out of town, but you may still be determined to make it work with cars and feet.

Ultimately, we never used this version of the game for our show given the number of narrative threads and players it would require to pull off. You, however, are probably not making a show, and therefore might actually be able to make this work.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"general_tips":{"id":"general_tips","title":"General Tips","description":"Make no mistake, Hide and Seek is a physically and mentally demanding game. Particularly for medium and large sized games, which can last multiple days, adequate preparation is hugely important and should not be disregarded when organizing your game. Here are a few tips for staying healthy and comfortable while playing Hide and Seek:","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"hiding/hiding":{"id":"hiding/hiding","title":"Hiding","description":"As the hider, it is your job to stay hidden for as long as possible; stay hidden for longer than anyone else, and the game is yours. At the start of each run, you\'ll be given a certain amount of time to choose\u2013and travel to\u2013a hiding zone somewhere on your map. While the seekers close in, you\'ll have to juggle the tasks of answering questions, scoping out a perfect final hiding spot, and assembling the perfect hand using cards from the hider deck.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"hiding/hiding_spots":{"id":"hiding/hiding_spots","title":"Hiding Spots","description":"Once the seekers have entered your hiding zone and the end game has begun, you must stay put in a single spot until they\'ve found you\u2013this is your final hiding spot.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"hiding/hiding_zones":{"id":"hiding/hiding_zones","title":"Hiding Zones","description":"Your hiding zone is a circle located somewhere within the game map\u2013once the seekers start seeking, this zone is your new home.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"hiding/the_hider_deck/curses":{"id":"hiding/the_hider_deck/curses","title":"Curses","description":"Curse cards are played against the seekers as a means to slow them down, prevent them from asking questions, or just to annoy them. Every curse is unique, and has some kind of one-time effect on the seekers that lasts for a certain duration; much like powerups, once a curse has been used, it is then discarded and removed from your hand.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"hiding/the_hider_deck/customizing_your_deck":{"id":"hiding/the_hider_deck/customizing_your_deck","title":"Customizing Your Deck","description":"We\'ve provided you with a default hider deck that should most likely work out of the box without any adjustments. We do, however, encourage you to tinker with the deck and have provided some blank cards to help you customize it if you wish.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"hiding/the_hider_deck/powerups":{"id":"hiding/the_hider_deck/powerups","title":"Powerups","description":"There are several different types of powerup cards you can draw from the hider deck. These cards can be played at any time and allow you to take a particular type of advantageous action a single time; once powerup cards have been used, they are discarded and leave your hand. You only need to inform the seekers that you are using a powerup if that powerup has some kind of direct effect on them that they need to know about. These are the powerups in the hider deck:","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"hiding/the_hider_deck/the_hider_deck":{"id":"hiding/the_hider_deck/the_hider_deck","title":"The Hider Deck","description":"The hider deck is your one and only weapon to use against the seekers, so you\'ll have to use it wisely.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"hiding/the_hider_deck/time_bonuses":{"id":"hiding/the_hider_deck/time_bonuses","title":"Time Bonuses","description":"Time bonus cards come in varying values and count towards the hider\'s final hiding time. These cards cannot be \\"played,\\" and the only way that they leave the hider\'s hand is if they are discarded. Time bonuses are added to the hider\'s final hiding time only if they are in the hider\'s hand at the end of the round; discarding a time bonus means that it will no longer count towards your final hiding time. You should aim to hold as many time bonuses at the end of a round as possible. Time bonuses automatically scale based on your game size, so three values are listed on each card. Make sure you\'re using the right one for your game size!","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"quick_start_guide/asking_questions":{"id":"quick_start_guide/asking_questions","title":"Asking Questions","description":"In order to gather information about the hider\'s location, the seekers will have to ask questions from the investigation book. These questions can be asked at any time, as long as the previous question has been answered, and must be answered truthfully by the hider within 5 minutes, with the exception of photo questions, which must be answered within 10 minutes in small and medium games, and 20 minutes in large games. We ask hiders to make a good faith effort to answer all questions in the allotted time. However, if questions are not answered in the allowed time window, the hider\'s time is paused until the question is answered, and the hider will recieve no cards in exchange for answering.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"quick_start_guide/choosing_game_size":{"id":"quick_start_guide/choosing_game_size","title":"Choosing Game Size","description":"Hide and Seek is configured to be played at three different scales: small, medium, or large. These sizes have slightly different rules designed to work best with your map\'s size and complexity. Before you do any further setup, you\'ll need to determine whether you\'d like to play a small, medium, or large game of Hide and Seek.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"quick_start_guide/creating_teams":{"id":"quick_start_guide/creating_teams","title":"Creating Teams","description":"Generally, we do not recommend playing with more than four players. If you do want to play with more than four players, we would suggest grouping some players into teams. Those teams (of two or more) could collectively act as a single player, all hiding together when it is their turn to hide. There may be some unforseen awkwardness with how to answer certain questions that are intended for a single player, which will need to be resolved on a case-by-case basis. Teams are also recommended when playing with younger players, or in any context where a hider would feel unsafe or uncomfortable being alone for an extended period of time.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"quick_start_guide/hiding_zones":{"id":"quick_start_guide/hiding_zones","title":"Hiding Zones","description":"At the end of the hiding period, the hider must be at a transit station/stop that is included in the game\'s map\u2013this now acts as the center of their hiding zone. The hiding zone extends a certain distance in all directions from the transit station, forming a circle within which the hider may move freely until the end game begins. For small and medium games, the hiding zone extends a \xbc mile from the transit station; for large games, the hiding zone extends a \xbd mile from the transit station. (For more information on hiding zones and hiding spots, visit Hiding Zones)","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"quick_start_guide/quick_start_guide":{"id":"quick_start_guide/quick_start_guide","title":"Quick Start Guide","description":"Welcome to Hide and Seek! Let\'s cut to the chase","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"quick_start_guide/rotating_rounds":{"id":"quick_start_guide/rotating_rounds","title":"Rotating Rounds","description":"The hider is considered found once the seekers are within 5 feet of them and have spotted them. If the seekers are near the hider but haven\'t yet identified them, then the seeker hasn\'t been caught. At this point, the hider\'s clock is stopped, and all time bonus cards currently in the hider\'s hand are added to their time total.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"quick_start_guide/round_start":{"id":"quick_start_guide/round_start","title":"Round Start","description":"At the start of each round, one player/team will become the hider, while the remaining players will band together to play as the round\'s seekers. The order in which each player hides should be determined, at random, before the game begins.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"quick_start_guide/setting_your_map":{"id":"quick_start_guide/setting_your_map","title":"Setting Your Map","description":"After you have chosen a game size and assembled your players, you\'ll need to set up your game map. This involves choosing a transit system and establishing map borders. (For more information on setting up your map, visit Setting Up Your Map)","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"quick_start_guide/the_end_game":{"id":"quick_start_guide/the_end_game","title":"The End Game","description":"Once the seekers have entered the hider\'s hiding zone\u2013and are no longer on a mode of transit\u2013the end game will begin. At this point, the hider may no longer move freely; they must stay put in a publicly accessible hiding spot until they are found. (For more information on permissible hiding spots, visit Hiding Spots) During the end game, some questions may be impossible to answer due to restrictions on the hider\'s movement. For example, a photo question that would require the hider to take a photo from the train station, when they are not at the train station, would not be possible. In these cases, \\"I cannot answer the question\\" is considered a valid answer, and the hider would still pull a card. All questions other than photo questions that must be taken from a particular location should be possible to answer during the end game.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"quick_start_guide/the_hider_deck":{"id":"quick_start_guide/the_hider_deck","title":"The Hider Deck","description":"The hider deck contains three types of cards that the hider can use to their advantage: time bonus cards, powerup cards, and curse cards. Cards are drawn after a question is answered, and kept in the hider\'s hand until they are played or discarded in the discard pile. The hider can keep 6 cards in their hand at a time (unless their hand size has been expanded through a powerup.) If, at any point, the hider has exceeded their hand limit, they must immediately play or discard cards until they only have 6 cards remaining. (For more information on the hider deck, visit The Hider Deck)","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"seeking/a_note_about_mapping_apps":{"id":"seeking/a_note_about_mapping_apps","title":"A Note About Mapping Apps","description":"(And Their Errors)","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"seeking/matching_questions":{"id":"seeking/matching_questions","title":"Matching Questions","description":"Matching Questions follow the format, \\"Is your nearest \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ the same as my \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Valid answers are yes or no. Hiders have five minutes to answer. These questions can be useful at any point in the game, though they often require the seekers to move in order to optimize their efficacy. It is important to note that if locations are not within a map\'s boundaries, players must operate as if they do not exist. For example, if the seekers asked if they shared the same nearest commercial airport as the hider, but the only commercial airports were outside the map\'s boundaries, it would return a null answer (null answers count as answered questions, and hiders get to draw cards).","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"seeking/measuring_questions":{"id":"seeking/measuring_questions","title":"Measuring Questions","description":"Measuring questions follow the format, \\"Compared to me, are you closer to or further from \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\?\\" Valid answers are closer or further. Hiders have five minutes to answer. These questions are also universally useful, and good for slicing the map in unique and clever ways. It is important to note that if locations are not within a map\'s boundaries, players must operate as if they do not exist. For example, if the seekers asked if they were closer to or further from an international border than the hider, but there were no international borders in the map\'s boundaries, it would return a null answer (null answers count as answered questions, and hiders get to draw cards).","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"seeking/photo_questions":{"id":"seeking/photo_questions","title":"Photo Questions","description":"Photo questions follow the format, \\"Send me a photo of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\.\\" Valid answers are a photo that meets the full specifications of the photo question, or \\"I cannot answer the question,\\" in situations where the subject of the photograph doesn\'t exist in the hiding zone. Hiders have ten minutes to answer in small and medium games, and twenty minutes to answer in large games. All photos must be sent in your phone\'s normal aspect ratio. Photos are a useful way of getting a general sense of where the hider is, or for verifying that you\'ve arrived at the right location, but you cannot access Google Street View to assess photos or verify stations from afar.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"seeking/radar_questions":{"id":"seeking/radar_questions","title":"Radar Questions","description":"Radar questions follow the format, \\"Are you within \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ of me?\\" Valid answers are yes or no. Hiders have five minutes to answer. These questions are a good way of verifying whether you are in the right general area, or crossing off a particularly dense part of the map. (It is easiest to measure these distances using a long press or right click in Google Maps, and using the \\"Measure\\" tool.) It\'s important to note that radars are asking about your location, not your hiding zone. If the radar would encompass part of your hiding zone, but not your location at the time of answering, it would be a miss.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"seeking/seeking":{"id":"seeking/seeking","title":"Seeking","description":"As the seeker, it is your job to move and gather information as efficiently as possible. At your disposal are 80 questions, which you can ask the hider at any time. The hider must answer all of your questions truthfully, but in exchange for answers, they\'ll be rewarded with cards from their hider deck. Choosing the right questions at the right time is the key to a quick round\u2013ask too many questions and you\'ll be bogged down with curses or blown out with hours of time bonuses.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"seeking/tentacle_questions":{"id":"seeking/tentacle_questions","title":"Tentacle Questions","description":"Tentacle questions follow the format, \\"Within \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ miles of me, which \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ are you nearest to? (You must also be within \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ miles)\\" If the hider is within the reach of the tentacle question, they must answer with the name of one of the locations requested. If the hider is not within reach of the tentacle question, they may simply answer that they are not within reach. Hiders have five minutes to answer. These questions are most useful near the end of the game, to quickly dispense of density at an extremely high cost. To help visualize this, think of each of these locations (say, all the zoos) becoming tentacles that shoot out from the seekers. They feel around, and one will hit the hider and ping back.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"seeking/thermometer_questions":{"id":"seeking/thermometer_questions","title":"Thermometer Questions","description":"Thermometer questions follow the format, \\"After traveling \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\, am I hotter or colder?\\" Valid answers are hotter or colder. Hiders have five minutes to answer. When starting a thermometer question, you should inform the hider that you are starting a thermometer and send them your current location (we recommend sending a pin through Google or Apple Maps.) Then, after traveling a sufficient distance\u2013measured as the crow flies\u2013send them your new location. If the new location is closer to the hider\'s current location, then you are hotter. Otherwise, you are colder. These questions are a good way of determining whether you are moving in the right direction.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"setting_up_your_map/choosing_a_transit_system":{"id":"setting_up_your_map/choosing_a_transit_system","title":"Choosing a Transit System","description":"Your local transit system is the backbone of Hide and Seek. While this game can be played with cars or on foot, as we will detail later, we strongly recommend using public transit for this game. Hide and Seek can be played on trains, trams, metros, light rails, buses, ferries, or any other form of public transit, but you\'ll need to define which systems are in play before starting your game. Given that each hiding zone will be centered around a transit station, it\'s crucial that your game includes a sufficient number of stations to keep it engaging and open-ended\u2013this should determine how many different systems you\'ll want to include. (If, for example, you have a metro system that only has a few dozen stops, you should consider layering a bus system on top of it to increase complexity.)","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"setting_up_your_map/considering_rest_periods":{"id":"setting_up_your_map/considering_rest_periods","title":"Considering Rest Periods","description":"If your game is large enough to potentially span multiple days, you will also need to set rest periods for each day. For the sake of fairness, we recommend doing this ahead of time. These can be as long as you\'d like, so long as all players reset to their exact positions when the game resumes. We\'d recommend a minimum of 10 hours, in order for all players to get sufficient rest.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"setting_up_your_map/ending_your_game":{"id":"setting_up_your_map/ending_your_game","title":"Ending Your Game","description":"Generally, Hide and Seek ends once the predetermined number of rounds is complete. If, however, you\'re playing with a hard out (i.e. you have a flight home or, you know, need to go to school/work) we would also recommend setting an end-of-game timer. In that case, the game would end whenever you reach the predetermined number of rounds or the timer runs out, whichever comes first.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"setting_up_your_map/setting_map_borders":{"id":"setting_up_your_map/setting_map_borders","title":"Setting Map Borders","description":"After you\'ve determined the edges of your transit system, you\'ll need to establish a set of definitive borders for your game\'s map. As we\'ve mentioned, the scale of your map is entirely up to you\u2013whether it spans your country or continent\u2013but it is crucial that all players are using the exact same set of borders. In some cases, these borders can be naturally emergent and easily standardized; a game that spans a single country, for example, can simply be contained to the borders of that country. For smaller scale games\u2013like those that take place in a single city or metro area\u2013natural borders might be more ill-defined. (How big is Atlanta? No one knows!) In these cases, we would recommend setting your own hard borders using a tool like Google My Maps. Generally, it\'s best to draw a square or circle that encompasses the totality of the transit system you plan on using for your game.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"setting_up_your_map/setting_up_your_map":{"id":"setting_up_your_map/setting_up_your_map","title":"Setting Up Your Map","description":"Our goal, when designing Hide and Seek, was to make a game that can be played almost anywhere in the world. In order to accomplish this, we established a few simple steps that should generate a viable game map wherever you choose to play. Here\'s how to set the parameters of your game:","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}}')}}]);
