We designed the game, and our question categories, with Google Maps in mind, so you'll likely get the best gameplay when using it. It's also the only major mapping app where it is easy to measure distances, which will often be necessary for questions. In order to measure a distance, hold down anywhere on Google Maps that is not a formally listed location. A pin will pop up and if you scroll down you can select \"measure distance,\" then drag to measure from that point.
